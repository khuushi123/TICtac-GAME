# TICtac-GAME
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.     Features:  Two-player mode: Play against another player locally.
